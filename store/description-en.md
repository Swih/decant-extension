Decant the web. Extract pure, AI-ready content from any page — Markdown, JSON, MCP — one click.

## Detailed Description

### 🔥 Extract clean content from any web page in one click

Decant strips away the noise — ads, navigation, popups — and gives you the pure content of any web page in Markdown, structured JSON, or MCP format. Perfect for AI workflows, research, note-taking, and data collection.

### Why Decant?

Every web page is buried under menus, sidebars, ads, and cookie banners. When you need the actual content — for feeding into an AI, saving research, or archiving — you waste time copy-pasting and cleaning up. Decant does it in one click.

**Smart extraction:**
• Powered by Mozilla's Readability algorithm (same as Firefox Reader View)
• Automatic table detection and conversion
• Email, date, and price extraction
