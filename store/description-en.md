## Detailed Description

NEW IN V2.0: MCP BRIDGE — LET CLAUDE READ YOUR BROWSER

Decant now connects your Chrome tabs directly to Claude Desktop. Ask Claude to summarize what you're reading, compare multiple pages, or research any URL — all through Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP).

No copy-pasting. No prompt formatting. Just tell Claude what you need, and Decant feeds it the clean web content.

FOR AI POWER USERS

"Claude, summarize the article in my active tab."
"Claude, compare the pricing pages in tabs 2 and 5."
"Claude, go to docs.example.com and extract the API reference."

Decant's MCP Bridge gives Claude Desktop real-time access to your browser. Four MCP tools at your fingertips:

- list_tabs — See all open Chrome tabs
- extract_active_tab — Read the page you're currently viewing
- extract_tab — Read any specific tab by ID
- extract_url — Open a URL, extract it, close the tab automatically

All communication happens over a local WebSocket (localhost:22816). Your data never touches the internet.

FOR HUMANS: ONE-CLICK WEB EXTRACTION

Even without MCP, Decant is the fastest way to extract clean content from any web page:

- Markdown Export — Clean text with headings, code blocks, links, and images. Perfect for pasting into ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Obsidian, or Notion.
- JSON Export — Structured data with metadata for developers and automated workflows.
- MCP Format — Native Model Context Protocol output for Claude-powered agents and AI tool chains.
