Extract clean content from any web page in one click.

Decant strips away the noise — ads, navigation, popups, cookie banners — and gives you the pure content of any web page in Markdown, structured JSON, or MCP format. Built for AI workflows, research, note-taking, and data collection. 100% local, nothing leaves your device.

WHAT DECANT DOES

Decant extracts the main content from any web page and converts it into clean, usable formats. It uses Mozilla Readability (the same engine behind Firefox Reader View) to detect the article body, then converts it using Turndown for Markdown output.

• Extracts articles, blog posts, documentation, wiki pages, news articles
• Converts HTML tables to proper Markdown or JSON tables
• Detects structured data: emails, dates, prices, phone numbers
• Preserves headings, links, images, and formatting
• Works on any website you can open in Chrome

WHAT DECANT DOES NOT DO

• Does NOT crawl or scrape multiple pages — it extracts one page at a time (or all open tabs via Batch)
• Does NOT send data to any server — all processing is 100% local in your browser
• Does NOT require an account, API key, or subscription
• Does NOT modify web pages — it only reads and converts content
• Does NOT work on Chrome internal pages (chrome://), the Chrome Web Store, or PDF files

THREE OUTPUT FORMATS

Markdown
